# Dark Mode

The latest JSBox version has supported Dark Mode, not only for the app itself, but also provided some easy-to-use APIs for creating dark-mode-perfect scripts.

This chapter talks about how does it work, and how to make your scripts Dark Mode ready.

# theme

`theme` specifies the appearance preference, its possible values are `light` / `dark` / `auto`, stand for light mode, dark mode and system default.

It can be a global setting like this:

```js
$app.theme = "auto";
```

Alternatively, uses the value in the [config.json](en/package/intro.md) file:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "theme": "auto"
  }
}
```

Other than set that globally, you can also set a certain value for each screens, in its `props`:

```js
$ui.push({
  props: {
    "theme": "light"
  }
});
```

> Note, to avoid breaking your existing scripts, the default value of `theme` would be `light`. If you'd like to adapt dark mode, turn it to `auto`, then adjust your colors.

Default controls have different colors under different themes, please refer to the latest [UIKit-Catalog](https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/blob/master/extension-scripts/uikit-catalog.js) demo for more information.

# Dynamic Colors

In order support different colors for light and dark, you can now create dynamic colors like this:

```js
const dynamicColor = $color({
  light: "#FFFFFF",
  dark: "#000000"
});
```

It can also be simplified as:

```js
const dynamicColor = $color("#FFFFFF", "#000000");
```

Colors can be nested, it can use colors generated by the `$rgba(...)` method:

```js
const dynamicColor = $color($rgba(0, 0, 0, 1), $rgba(255, 255, 255, 1));
```

Dynamic colors show different colors in light mode or dark mode, no need to observe theme changes and switch them manually.

Also, there are some [semantic colors](en/function/index.md?id=colorstring), you can use them directly.

# events: themeChanged

Theme changes will emit a `themeChanged` event for all views:

```js
$ui.render({
  views: [
    {
      type: "view",
      layout: $layout.fill,
      events: {
        themeChanged: (sender, isDarkMode) => {
          // Update UI if needed
        }
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

This provides a chance to change some UI details dynamically, such as using different images, or changing its alpha value.

# Embrace Dark Mode

In general, there are three things you should do:

- Set `theme` to `auto`
- Use `$color(light, dark)` to create dynamic colors
- Leverage `themeChanged` to update UI details

As the mechanism continues to improve, we may provide support for dynamic images in the future, which should make your life easier. Besides, the default value of `theme` is just a temporary solution for the transition period, it might be `auto` in the future, to make scripts that only use default controls support dark mode by default.
